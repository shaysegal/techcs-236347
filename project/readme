1. Synthesizer Modes:
Our synthesizer operates in four primary modes:

a. PBE simple Mode:
- In this mode, our synthesizer generates Python programs based on provided input-output examples.
- This mode is called simple PBE mode because the programs its get mostly are simple programs such like equations.
- 

b. PBE Mode - As Part of Program:
- The key components of this mode are similar to the simple PBE mode but can be used to synthesize more complex programs.
-
-


c. ASSERT simple Mode:
- In this mode, our synthesizer can handle simple assertions in programs.
- mostly the assertions will shown up straight after line it relevant to.

d. ASSERT Mode - As Part of Program:
- The key components of this mode are similar to the simple ASSERT mode but can be used to synthesize more complex programs.
- 


2. Synthesizer Ability:
- Our synthesizer can generate Python programs based on examples (PBE mode) and generate assertions (ASSERT mode) within existing programs. 
- Our synthesizer can get as User Input in all 4 modes and Synthesize a program based on the input.
- Our synthesizer sketch support constanst, Integers, Strings.


3. Synthesizer Limits:
- Our synthesizer can't handle assertion inside loops.
- 

5. How to Insert Input in User Input Mode:
We should explain how users can interact with our synthesizer to provide input for program synthesis or assertion generation.
